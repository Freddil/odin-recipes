    <h4>Ingredients <em>(Feeds 3 -4 adults)</em></h4>
    <ul>
        <li>75g ghee</li>
        <li>300g skinless white fish like hake</li>
        <li>200g skinless salmon</li>
        <li>200g raw peeled prawn</li>
        <li>100g mussels</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>For the curry sauce</h4>
    <ul>
    <li>1 onion , roughly chopped</li>
    <li>100g ginger , chopped</li>
    <li>50ml vegetable oil</li>
    <li>2 tsp garam masala</li>
    <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
    <li>1 red chilli , deseeded and finely chopped</li>
    <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>For the curry sauce, whizz the onion and ginger together to a purée. Heat the oil in a large pan until smoking. Add the garam marsala and sizzle for 30 secs, then add the onion and ginger purée, reduce the heat and slowly cook for 5 mins. Add the remaining spices, fry for 1 min, stir in the chilli and fry for another min, then add the tomatoes and a good pinch of salt and grind of pepper, and stir well. You can do this way in advance, then just throw the curry together on the night – the sauce will freeze or keep in the fridge for up to 3 days.</li>
        <li>To make the curry, melt a third of the ghee in a large pan. Cook the white fish for 2-3 mins until lightly browned, then set aside on a plate. Repeat this process with the salmon and prawns, adding another third of ghee each time. For the mussels, heat a medium-sized saucepan on a high heat. Add the mussels with 2 tbsp of water, cover tightly with a lid, and steam for 3-4 mins, shaking the pan every so often. Drain and set aside with the other seafood.</li>
        <li>Bring the sauce to the boil, stir the fish and mussels in gently, bring to the boil again, then remove from the heat and leave for 3-4 mins – the fish will finish cooking in the heat from the sauce. Add the coriander leaves and serve with Spiced rice and Carrot & cumin salad (see 'Goes well with' on the right of this page).</li>
    </ol>
